# Chat-AI-practice

## Description

This project demonstrates the integration of the OpenAI language model, specifically "gpt-3.5-turbo," with a Node.js command-line interface (CLI) using Inquirer for user interaction. Its primary purpose is to provide coding assistance by allowing users to ask questions about programming.

Upon initializing the script, the user is prompted to input a coding-related question. The input is then passed to the OpenAI model for processing, generating a response that includes an answer to the user's question and an explanation of the answer. This response is formatted and displayed to the user.

The project also includes a structured output parser to easily extract and present relevant information from the AI response. It handles two key outputs: the answer itself and an explanation of the answer.

By combining AI-powered language understanding with user-friendly CLI interaction, this project offers an efficient tool for developers and coders seeking quick and informative answers to their coding queries. It exemplifies the potential of AI-driven assistance in enhancing user experiences within the realm of coding and development.
